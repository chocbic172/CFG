# CFG - CORRUPT FILE GENERATOR
Python Corrupt File / Huge Number Generator


This peice of software generates massive numbers thanks to the python open() technique. It asks the user to specify the name and file type and saves a huge number to this file. Therefore, when it is labelled as an MP4 or pretty much any other file type (except txt, py, or any other text based file), if a user tries to open the file, it is corrupt! I know this is probably the worst way to go about creating a corrupt file... but it works!
